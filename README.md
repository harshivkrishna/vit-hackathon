# Tree Plantation Recommendation System

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Planting trees is a crucial step in combating climate change, enhancing biodiversity, and improving urban living conditions. However, determining the right location and type of tree to plant requires careful consideration of environmental factors. This project provides an intelligent system that recommends suitable locations for planting trees based on factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and the number of existing trees.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Urban and rural areas alike face challenges in optimizing afforestation efforts. Improper planting can lead to tree failure, wasted resources, and environmental imbalance. The lack of accessible, data-driven tools for planning afforestation contributes to these inefficiencies. 

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a recommendation system that empowers individuals and organizations to make informed decisions about where and what trees to plant.
